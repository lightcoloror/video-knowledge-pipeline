# Intent: expose the pinned sherpa-onnx adapter through a stable local front
# door without modifying the busy shared video-knowledge.ps1 dispatcher.
# Decision: forward arguments to the module CLI; explicit model/command paths
# remain part of the exact plan.
# Reason: this avoids a second execution service and preserves fail-closed
# preview/execute behavior.
# Evidence: the module CLI and offline candidate-evidence regressions are
# documented in docs/sherpa-onnx-speaker-diarization-adapter-2026-07-28.md.
# Effective scope: local planning/execution only; no download, upload, fallback,
# provider call, or primary transcript mutation.
