# Third-party notices

Updated: 2026-08-15 21:30:35 +08:00 by Codex (GPT-5.6 Sol)

VKP's own source is licensed under `AGPL-3.0-only`. That license does not replace the licenses of third-party packages, browser assets, independently installed tools, model weights, datasets, or hosted APIs.

This document is an attribution and boundary record, not legal advice. The commit-level engineering provenance is maintained in [the external-code reuse ledger](docs/external-code-reuse-ledger-2026-07-04.md).

## Distributed in this repository

| Component | Version / source | License | Distribution boundary |
|---|---|---|---|
| WaveSurfer.js and Regions plugin | 7.12.11, `katspaugh/wavesurfer.js` | BSD-3-Clause | Minified browser assets are vendored under `src/video_knowledge_pipeline/static/wavesurfer-7.12.11/`; the full upstream license is retained beside them. |

VKP adds two explicit adapter slots and separate VKP CSS/JS; launcher, provider/API-key UI, server, model code, and FFmpeg orchestration are excluded. |

No model weights, customer media, production transcripts, or evaluation datasets are distributed in this repository.

## Reviewed or adapted upstream designs

The following are not vendored source trees. VKP either calls an independently managed runtime, consumes a saved-output contract, or independently adapts a bounded algorithm/contract. Detailed decisions, fixed commits, tests, and rejected modules are in the reuse ledger.

## Reference-only and rejected code

- `WEIFENG2333/VideoCaptioner` at `95842ecb5618c0b6a548a336bdfb0eb859bdb501` is GPL-3.0. VKP reviewed its architecture but copied no source; it is not a runtime or dependency.
- Projects with absent, proprietary, conflicting, or unverified licenses remain reference-only or rejected as recorded in the reuse ledger. Their code must not be copied into VKP without a new license review.
- AGPL licensing of VKP does not convert a reference-only checkout, independent executable, hosted API, model, or dataset into VKP-owned code.

## Models and datasets

Model code licenses and model-weight licenses are separate. VKP does not grant rights to SenseVoice, CAM++, MOSS, Qwen, Gemini, DeepSeek, OCR, embedding, tagging, highlight-detection, or other weights/services. Operators must review the exact model card, provider terms, acceptable-use policy, and territorial/data-processing rules before use.

Dataset annotations and media also retain their own licenses and consent requirements. AutoShot, ClipShots, MovieNet, Video-MME, SlideVQA, internal course videos, and customer recordings are not included. Tests in this repository use synthetic or de-identified fixtures only.
